    <h3>Written Questions</h3><br>
    <ol>
        <li>My dashboard considers the football dataset and answers each question using a different form of graph. 
            The first question asks about the number of games played per year, and I decided to create a line graph
            that shows the number of games per year since the mid-nineteenth century til present. It very clearly
            shows the trends over time very clearly; in addition to a standard line, I also filled in the area
            under the line with a gradient matching the color scheme and meaning of the other graphs. While
            this information is also shown on the axis, it makes the graph more aesthetic and consistent with
            the other graphs based on the shared color scheme. I also decided to show all years possible
            in order to maximize the amount of information clearly shown. In my second graph, I showed the
            winning percentages of the top nations using a map! While this took quite a bit of time to build,
            there, of course, is no better way of displaying geographic data. This is a chloropleth map, which
            means that the color directly corresponds to the win percentage (darker is a higher win percent.
            While the question wanted to see this information for ten countries, I built in an interactive
            element that allows the user to visualize up to 125 countries (only countries over a certain
            threshold of games were included) with a dynamic color scale. The tooltip also shows the exact
            country and win percentage! The only disadvantage is that very geographically small countries
            do not show up on the map (so while there are supposed to be ten countries at the default map,
            only seven are actually visible -- Jersey, for example, is a small island that is not visible!). 
            My third graph looked at data exclusively from the 2013/2014 and 2017/2018 World Cup and World Cup
            Qualifying Teams, and for each team during that period, calculated the percentage of games they won,
            the average win margin, the total number of games they played, and the average win percentage of their
            opponent. I took the top twenty and normalized their values (i.e. so the max in each set would be 1 and
            the min 0) then summed them up into a "total score". I displayed this data in a heat map! The first column
            on the left, separated by the line, shows the top countries ranked in descending order by their total score,
            then each category on the right shows how each country does in each category. Since these color scales were
            normalized, I also built a tooltip to actually show each value. I think the heat map was a great choice of graph
            for this question because it allows for easy comparison of different statistics between countries. This combination
            of factors and the sum help to show which countries might be most likely to win in 2022
            </li>
        <li>First, D3 was helpful because of its support for all sorts of different graphs -- while I could make a line
            plot easily in MatPlotLib or Excel, making a map or heat map might have been much harder. As a result, using D3
            allowed me to access and create a greater variety of graphs rather than boring bar/line/scatter plots. Another
            part of D3 that was great was the interactive component -- this, of course, is not easily done with typical
            graphing programs. The relative ease of adding tooltips and interactive elements is powerful and flexible -- I was
            shocked how easily I was able to implement a slider, despite relative inexperience with HTML/JS/CSS. These interactive
            elements make the graphs so much better and more useful. In the past, I have used Tableau extensively using the student
            license, but it is wildly expensive. Now, I can basically create anything I might have made in Tableau with D3 completely
            open-source, which is pretty darn cool. A final reason that D3 improved my plots were its flexibility! Because it is code
            based, you can literally do whatever you want which lets you tweak the graph until it is perfect. For example, I was able to
            disable the tooltip for countries not showing data, and using a conditional block I was able to show a percent sign in the
            tooltip in Graph 3 for some columns but not others. One issue I have had using Tableau is its lack of flexibility, and D3
            solves this -- I will definitely use D3 instead of Tableau in the future if given the opportunity!
            </li>
        <li>One issue D3 can be less than ideal is that working with constraints / sizing can be tough -- because some of my values are
            hard-coded in the SVG blocks, I'm concerned it might not show up well on other display sizes or mobile devices. Another reason
            not to use D3 is that while it is very flexible, this also makes it very time-consuming to build -- I could build a comparable
            plot in Tableau for the map in about ten minutes, which I suppose is the price you pay for open-source software and flexibility!
            Finally, it requires more complicated infastructure; you can't just paste an image on your website, you need to properly
            set it up on a web server which may not be useful for some contexts, potentially this one. But these are relatively small things,
            as overall I have found D3 to be really cool!

        <h3>Accessible Data Visualization</h3>
        <li>There are both accessible and inaccessible parts of the dashboard. The Betterment.com article suggests making sure that all visualizations
            are within SVG format, as this allows visually impaired people using screen readers to read the text within the chart, which I have done in 
            all three of my graphs. I also worked to maximize contrast wherever possible, also as suggested by the Betterment article. Also, I did not
            include sound or animations that might unnecesarily inhibit the experiences of deaf people or people with epilepsy as described in the Medium
            article. However, my visualization still might pose issues for people with visual disabilities. People with tritanomaly/tritanopia color
            blindness might not be able to tell apart blue and green in the legend; I could look at and consider using different color scales to rectify 
            this. I did not summarize my graphs anywhere, in an "alt" statement or elsewhere for people who cannot actually see the graph; this would be an
            easy addition using an "alt" statement. Finally, I did not publish the underlying CSV, which people who cannot see the graph might want to looke
            at so they can understand the underlying numbers too (of course it's in the directory, but I still could make it more easily accessible). Fixing
            these issues would make my dashboard much more accessible to all viewers but particularly to those with visual disabilities!
            </li>
        <li> Honestly, I did not take these steps because I did not even think about how I should make the dashboard accessible to those with disabilities
            until after I had completed my homework, unfortunately -- it didn't come to mind, so it didn't factor into my design decisions. Next time, now
            that I know what I have learned from these readings, when planning the design and layout of my dashboard, I would consider accessbility components.
            As a result, I would natively implement things like alt text, spacing between graphs, color-blind friendly color scales, publishing CSVs of data,
            summary descriptions of graphs, and other things. So the key thing is to think about accessibility BEFORE writing code and not after!
